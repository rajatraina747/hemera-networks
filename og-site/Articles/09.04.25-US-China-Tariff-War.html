											<h2>U.S.-China Trade Conflict Escalates Dramatically Amid Record Tariffs and Market Turmoil</h2>

											<p>Trade tensions between the United States and China have reached new heights, prompting severe economic repercussions worldwide. President Donald Trump's administration imposed unprecedented tariff measures on Chinese imports, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing trade conflict.</p>

											<p>Effective today, the U.S. has enacted a comprehensive tariff regime featuring a baseline duty of 10% on all imported goods, coupled with significantly higher tariffs targeting specific countries. Chinese imports have been notably impacted, facing a cumulative tariff rate of 104%, including previously existing duties and newly announced retaliatory measures.</p>

											<p>In response, China swiftly announced a retaliatory tariff of 34% on all U.S. goods, effective from April 10, 2025. Furthermore, Chinese authorities have implemented stringent export controls on rare earth elements, which are critical components used in advanced technology and defence industries.</p>

											<p>The global market reaction has been swift and severe, with significant declines recorded across major indices. The S&P 500 index has suffered substantial losses, falling below the critical 5,000-point threshold for the first time in nearly a year. The intensified conflict has also led to record depreciation of the Chinese yuan, reaching an all-time low of 7.4288 against the U.S. dollar.</p>

											<p>President Trump has escalated the rhetoric further by threatening an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods if China does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs. China, standing firm, has vowed to "fight to the end" and has filed an official complaint with the World Trade Organization, asserting that the U.S. tariffs violate established international trade regulations.</p>

											<p>Analysts warn that the continued escalation in trade hostilities between the world's two largest economies poses severe risks to global economic stability. With no immediate resolution in sight, businesses, investors, and governments around the world brace for ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty.</p>
