      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Crystal Palace swept into their first FA Cup final since 2016 with a commanding 3-0 victory over Aston Villa, a performance powered by a long-range strike from Eberechi Eze and a second-half brace by Ismaïla Sarr. The result puts Oliver Glasner’s revitalised side one match from ending the club’s 119-year wait for a major trophy; they will face either Manchester City or Nottingham Forest at Wembley on 17 May.</p>

        <h2>Seizing control early</h2>
        <p>Palace seized control just after the half-hour when Eze collected Sarr’s pass on the left edge of the penalty area, stepped inside and bent an unstoppable shot beyond Emiliano Martínez—his ninth goal of the season and the moment that ignited an 82,301-strong crowd under the arch.</p>

        <h2>Villa's missed chance</h2>
        <p>Aston Villa were handed a lifeline early in the second period when Jean-Philippe Mateta fired a penalty over the crossbar, but the reprieve lasted only nine minutes. Pressing high and in numbers, Palace forced a turnover on halfway; Eze threaded a pass through the channel and Sarr finished low across Martínez to double the advantage. The Senegal winger struck again in stoppage time, side-footing home after Daniel Muñoz’s cut-back to complete a victory every bit as emphatic as the scoreline suggests.</p>

        <h2>Glasner's transformation</h2>
        <p>Glasner, appointed 14 months ago, has overseen a startling transformation: Palace have now scored nine unanswered goals against Villa across league and cup and boast the competition’s meanest defence, conceding only twice en-route to the final. Villa, meanwhile, looked leg-weary after their mid-week Champions League exit and were further hampered by the absence of injured forward Marcus Rashford.</p>

        <h2>A historic occasion awaits</h2>
        <p>Saturday’s win marks only Palace’s third appearance in an FA Cup showpiece—after defeats to Manchester United in 1990 and 2016—and extends a memorable season that has already delivered their highest Premier League points tally at this stage since promotion in 2013. One more Wembley triumph next month would re-write the club’s history; on the evidence of this muscular, high-octane display, few would bet against it.</p>
