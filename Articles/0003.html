      <div class="article-body">
        <p>A rapid overnight rise in the Jhelum River sent residents of Hattian Bala and low-lying neighbourhoods of Muzaffarabad scrambling for higher ground on Saturday after Pakistani officials said India released water from the Uri hydropower complex without prior notice. Local authorities declared a “moderate-flood emergency,” warning that river levels had jumped nearly a metre in four hours and could crest again with further upstream discharges.</p>

        <blockquote>‘People ran with only what they were wearing’</blockquote>

        <p>“Water started creeping into the market just after midnight; by dawn the main street was knee-deep,” said Mohammad Yasin, a shopkeeper in Chakothi village, a few kilometres from the Line of Control (LoC). District disaster-management officer Raja Zahid told reporters that at least 1,200 people were moved to schools and mosques on higher ground, though no deaths were immediately reported.</p>

        <h2>Islamabad alleges treaty breach</h2>
        <p>Pakistan’s Foreign Office condemned the release as a “flagrant violation” of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which requires advance flood warnings and data-sharing on western-river flows. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Islamabad would raise the matter with the World Bank, the treaty’s guarantor, and reserve “all options” if India continued what he called “hydrological warfare.”</p>

        <h2>New Delhi silent, but context is combustible</h2>
        <p>Indian officials did not issue a formal statement, and engineers at the state-run NHPC hydropower utility declined comment. The water dispute comes just days after New Delhi suspended the IWT altogether, saying Pakistan must curb cross-border terrorism before river cooperation can resume.</p>

        <h2>Political context and expert views</h2>
        <p>Analysts note that Saturday’s surge followed unusually heavy spring rain in Indian-held Kashmir, and releases from high-head dams are not uncommon. “Whether this was routine flood management or political signalling will set the tone for what happens next,” said water-security scholar Aditi Mukherjee.</p>

        <h2>Rising political temperature</h2>
        <p>India has outlined a three-step plan to restrict flows to Pakistan, ranging from new storage projects to real-time data cut-offs. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned that any deliberate tampering with river flows would be met with “a decisive response.” Cross-LoC shelling has already flared twice since Wednesday, underscoring how quickly water rows can feed into broader security tensions.</p>

        <h2>What happens next?</h2>
        <p>The Azad Jammu & Kashmir State Disaster Management Authority said it will keep flood sirens in place until gauges at Muzaffarabad fall below the “alert” threshold, expected late Sunday if no new surges occur. Pakistan’s Indus River System Authority has requested hourly discharge data from India; absent that, it plans to dispatch a formal notice of dispute through the World Bank in the coming week.</p>

        <h2>Hydrologists warn of flash-flood risk</h2>
        <p>Hydrologists on both sides warn that with glaciers melting faster and political trust evaporating, uncoordinated dam operations could turn routine spate releases into flash-flood catastrophes for millions living downstream. “Even wars have not stopped the two countries sharing river data—until now,” said former IWT commissioner Syed Shah. “That precedent is fraying, and so is the margin for error.”</p>
