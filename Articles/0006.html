      <div class="article-body">
        <p>After an 18-month shoot disrupted by Hollywood’s writers’ and actors’ strikes, Star Wars: <em>Andor</em> is gearing up for its final act. Disney+ confirmed that season two—and the series’ last—will debut with three episodes on 22 April 2025 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT (2 a.m. BST on 23 April), followed by weekly instalments across four tightly wound, three-episode arcs, concluding in mid-June.</p>

        <h2>Structure and release schedule</h2>
        <p>Show-runner Tony Gilroy has organised the 12-episode run into four mini-films, each covering three consequential days before leaping roughly a year ahead. Gilroy told NPR this rhythm propels protagonist Cassian Andor from seasoned mercenary to fully fledged Rebel spy “without the clunky exposition audiences have learned to tune out.” By the finale, the timeline dovetails directly into the opening scenes of <em>Rogue One</em>.</p>

        <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
        <p>Principal photography wrapped in February 2024 at Pinewood Studios and on location in Valencia, despite strike interruptions. Post-production has leaned heavily on Industrial Light & Magic, executing the franchise’s largest volume of stage-craft work outside <em>The Mandalorian</em>. A teaser at Star Wars Celebration Japan showcased Andor infiltrating an Imperial shipyard, Mon Mothma convening a nascent Rebel Council on Yavin IV, and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo of Director Orson Krennic.</p>

        <h2>Cast and characters</h2>
        <p>The core ensemble returns—Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor alongside Genevieve O’Reilly, Stellan Skarsgård, Adria Arjona, Denise Gough, Kyle Soller and Forest Whitaker—while new cast additions remain under wraps. Tony Gilroy quipped that the long-rumoured reappearance of droid K-2SO is still “classified,” though insiders confirm Alan Tudyk completed motion-capture for the role early in production.</p>

        <h2>Condensed final arc</h2>
        <p>Originally pitched as a five-season saga, <em>Andor</em> was streamlined to two, a move Gilroy says sharpened its pacing. “If we tried that plan we’d all be collecting pensions before we finished,” he joked on the Scriptnotes podcast, noting the condensed structure heightens the show’s thriller elements.</p>

        <h2>Early reception</h2>
        <p>Footage reactions at Celebration Japan praised the blend of political intrigue and ground-level grit that earned season one a Peabody Award and eight Emmy nominations. With Disney+ seeking to counter franchise fatigue, the streamer is banking on <em>Andor</em>’s critical acclaim and loyal fanbase to boost subscriptions this summer.</p>

        <p>When the final episode fades to black, Gilroy promises fans can jump straight into <em>Rogue One</em> without missing a beat: “We don’t slow down,” he said. “You could roll right into the film and not feel the seam.”</p>
