        <p>MUNICH ‚Äî Paris Saint-Germain finally conquered Europe on Saturday night, annihilating Inter Milan 5-0 in the Champions League final at the Allianz Arena to claim the club‚Äôs long-sought first European Cup and post the heaviest winning margin in the competition‚Äôs 69-year history.</p>

        <p>Former Inter full-back Achraf Hakimi punctured his old club after eight minutes, side-footing in Ousmane Demb√©l√©‚Äôs low cross. From there Luis Enrique‚Äôs youthful side never loosened their grip. Nineteen-year-old D√©sir√© Dou√© drove in a deflected strike on 20 minutes and added a crisp left-footer just past the hour, becoming only the third teenager to score twice in a European final and the first player of any age to manage three goal involvements in one.</p>

        <p>Inter, chasing a fourth continental crown, were suffocated by PSG‚Äôs high press and slick rotations. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia curled in a fourth on 78 minutes after a sweeping counter, before 18-year-old academy graduate Senny Mayulu came off the bench to prod home the fifth, capping a night that crystallised the Qatari-owned club‚Äôs pivot from gal√°ctico glamour to next-generation firepower.</p>

        <h2>Historic metrics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Largest final win:</strong> The 5-0 score surpasses Real Madrid‚Äôs 4-0 victory in 1960 as the biggest in a European Cup decider.</li>
          <li><strong>Youngest hero:</strong> Dou√© (19 yrs 362 days) is the youngest player to log two goals and an assist in a UCL final.</li>
          <li><strong>Luis Enrique‚Äôs double treble:</strong> The coach, who won the competition with Barcelona in 2015, becomes only the second manager after Pep Guardiola to complete two continental trebles with different clubs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reaction</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;Tonight we saw the future of PSG,&rdquo; captain Marquinhos beamed as he hoisted the big-eared trophy in front of 70,000 fans. Inter coach Simone Inzaghi conceded his side were &ldquo;overrun by intensity we could not match.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>
        <p>PSG complete an unprecedented French treble and will face Europa League winners Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup on 13 August. Inter must regroup before a Serie A defence that now feels secondary to repairing the scars of Munich&rsquo;s mauling.</p>

        <p>For Paris, a decade-long quest bankrolled by Qatari billions has reached its vindicating end &mdash; and, on the evidence of Munich, the journey may only just be beginning.</p>
