      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai on Wednesday blasted the U.S. Justice Department’s proposed remedies in its landmark search-monopoly case, calling the demand that Google share its entire search index and ranking data with competitors “far-reaching” and “extraordinary.” Forced data disclosure at “marginal cost,” he testified, would let rivals “reverse-engineer, end-to-end, any part of our technology stack” and make it “not clear … how to fund all the innovation we do.”</p>

        <h2>What the government wants</h2>
        <p>After Judge Amit Mehta ruled last August that Google illegally maintained a search monopoly, the DOJ and 14 states drafted a menu of remedies, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compulsory licensing of Google’s search index, algorithms and data to other engines.</li>
          <li>Divestiture of the Chrome browser within five years if competition fails to materialise.</li>
          <li>A possible future order to spin off Android should default-search payments and data-sharing prove insufficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prosecutors insist such measures are necessary to unwind what they call a “vicious cycle” of defaults, data and advertising cash that shuts out challengers. Google counters that the list reads like “a wish-list for competitors,” noting it spent $49&nbsp;billion on Search and AI last year alone.</p>

        <h2>Pichai’s defence</h2>
        <p>Under friendly questioning, Pichai framed Google as an innovation engine whose investments—more than 90&nbsp;percent of commits to the Chromium codebase and over $1&nbsp;billion a year on Chrome—would dry up if the court forces a sale or open-source giveaway. He warned that opening the index could also compromise user safety and privacy by exposing spam-fighting systems.</p>

        <h2>The bigger antitrust dragnet</h2>
        <p>The search-trial remedies phase overlaps with a separate Virginia case in which Judge Leonie&nbsp;Brinkema has already found Google dominates digital-ad technology and set a May 2 hearing to explore structural fixes that could include spinning off parts of its ad stack.</p>

        <h2>What happens next</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Closing briefs are due May 30; Mehta is expected to rule on remedies later this summer.</li>
          <li>Google has signalled it will appeal any order to divest or license core assets.</li>
          <li>Rivals OpenAI, Perplexity and Yahoo are slated to testify for the government on how access to Google’s data could reshape competition in generative AI and search.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Antitrust scholars say the case could rival the AT&amp;T and Standard Oil break-ups in scope. For now, it pits Washington’s most aggressive trust-buster agenda in decades against a company arguing that dismantling its ecosystem would “kill Google Search” and, by extension, hobble American innovation.</p>
