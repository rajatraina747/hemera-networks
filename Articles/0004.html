      <div class="article-body">
        <p>A festive Saturday night on South Vancouver’s Fraser Street turned to carnage when a black SUV broke through traffic barricades and barreled for nearly a block through the Lapu Lapu Day celebration, killing nine people and injuring dozens more, according to city police.</p>

        <h2>Minutes of chaos</h2>
        <p>The vehicle entered the pedestrian zone at 8:14 p.m., striking food stalls, performers and spectators before coming to rest against a concrete planter. Witnesses described “total panic” as bystanders tried to pull victims to safety. “It felt like the driver was aiming for anyone in front of him,” said street vendor Maricel Diaz, whose stall was destroyed.</p>

        <h2>Suspect held, terrorism ruled out for now</h2>
        <p>Officers and civilians subdued the 30-year-old driver, a Vancouver resident “known to police in certain circumstances,” Interim Police Chief Steve Rai told reporters. Investigators are “confident this was not an act of terrorism,” he said, but have yet to determine whether the assault was deliberate or the result of impairment or a medical crisis.</p>

        <h2>Community in shock</h2>
        <p>Mayor Ken Sim called the incident “horrific” and offered support to Vancouver’s 38,000-strong Filipino community. “Our thoughts are with all those affected during this incredibly difficult time,” he posted on X. Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” and paused federal-election campaigning to receive briefings. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he was “shattered” and instructed consular officials to assist victims’ families.</p>

        <h2>Festival cut short</h2>
        <p>The day-long block party, marking the heroism of 16th-century Filipino chieftain Lapu Lapu, had drawn several thousand people and featured a performance by Black Eyed Peas rapper APL.DE.AP moments before the crash. Organisers said the celebration “will return next year, but first we mourn, and we demand answers.”</p>

        <h2>What investigators are examining</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Driver’s background</strong> — No current criminal charges, but previous “police interactions,” Rai said.</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle data</strong> — A warrant has been issued to download the SUV’s onboard computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Event security</strong> — Temporary barricades met city standards; organisers had paid for six off-duty police officers, all stationed at stage front when the vehicle approached.</li>
          <li><strong>Victims</strong> — Five women and four men aged 17–64; names to be released once families notified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        <p>Police have appealed for dash-cam and phone footage taken between 8:00 p.m. and 8:20 p.m. along Fraser Street between East 41st and East 47th Avenues. A temporary family-reunification centre has opened at John Oliver Secondary School, and grief counsellors are on site.</p>

        <h2>Official reviews</h2>
        <p>British Columbia Premier David Eby said the province will fund an independent review of crowd-control measures at street events. “We have to know whether anything more could have been done,” he said.</p>

        <h2>Broader context</h2>
        <p>Canada has seen several high-profile vehicle-ramming incidents in recent years, including the 2018 Toronto van attack that killed 11. While Saturday’s tragedy is not currently labelled terrorism, security experts say it underscores the difficulty of protecting open-street festivals. “Concrete blocks and steel gates slow vehicles, but they can’t stop a determined driver unless they’re engineered to do so,” said University of British Columbia criminologist Justin Pritchard.</p>

        <p>With investigators still piecing together motive and sequence, Vancouver’s Filipino-Canadian community is left grieving what was meant to be a night of pride and joy. As volunteer candles flickered along Fraser Street, street-sweeper crews worked into the early hours to clear blood-stained vendor tents and broken folding chairs—mute reminders of lives cut short in an instant.</p>
