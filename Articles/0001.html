        <p>Preparations for Spain’s showcase cup final were plunged into turmoil on Friday when Real Madrid abruptly walked away from all mandatory media duties, accusing the match officials of “animosity and hostility” and demanding action from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). The protest came less than 24 hours before Real are due to face arch-rivals Barcelona at La Cartuja stadium in Seville.</p>

        <blockquote>“When your child goes to school and is told their father is a thief, it makes you sick.”</blockquote>

        <p>The emotional flashpoint arrived earlier in the day when referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears at a press conference, describing the personal toll of sustained criticism from Real Madrid TV, as VAR official Pablo González Fuertes warned that Spanish referees were ready to “make history” with collective action against abuse.</p>

        <p>Real’s in-house channel had stoked tensions by airing a slickly produced video claiming Madrid win only 64% of matches refereed by De Burgos, compared with Barcelona’s 81%—footage underscored by dramatic music and a narrator who questioned the referee’s “talent.” The clip, together with previous season-long montages targeting officials, was branded “unacceptable” by De Burgos.</p>

        <p>Late Friday, the club issued a three-page statement insisting its players would still contest the final but decrying the referees’ public comments as “inappropriate” and “threatening.” “Our team has never considered withdrawing,” the note read, while insisting that football’s core values “must prevail despite the hostility shown toward our club.”</p>

        <p>The RFEF rejected calls to replace the officiating crew and urged “calm and common sense.” Federation president Rafael Louzán told reporters the matter rested with the Technical Committee of Referees and appealed for the match to proceed “in the spirit millions of fans deserve.”</p>

        <p>Barcelona coach Hansi Flick backed the officials, saying “it is our responsibility to protect not only players but everyone involved in the game.” The Germans’ side enter tonight’s clásico chasing a domestic treble, while Madrid still harbour hopes of a league-and-cup double.</p>

        <p>Friday’s confrontation is the latest flashpoint in a season-long feud between Madrid and Spain’s refereeing establishment. In February the club filed a formal complaint over La Liga officiating, and Real Madrid TV has published more than a dozen critical compilations this term—moves some observers say have normalised online abuse of match officials.</p>

        <p>Kick-off is set for 10 p.m. local time (9 p.m. BST). Should tensions boil over on the pitch, it will mark only the second time in 11 years that a Copa del Rey final between these giants has been overshadowed by the man in the middle rather than the men with the ball.</p>
