        <p>“Through the Valley,” the second chapter of <em>The Last of Us</em> season 2, arrived on HBO/Max Sunday night and instantly reshaped the post-apocalyptic drama’s emotional landscape. Written by series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Mark Mylod, the 55-minute episode hurled viewers from a tense Jackson patrol into the franchise’s most controversial moment: the brutal murder of Joel Miller.</p>

        <h2>A death foretold, but no less shocking</h2>
        <p>Following a flashback of a young Abby Anderson searching the blood-soaked Firefly hospital, the story cuts to present-day Wyoming, where Abby’s strike team lures Joel and Tommy into an abandoned lodge. A golf club, not a gun, delivers the fatal blows—an image lifted straight from the 2020 videogame yet staged with new dread.</p>

        <h2>Stalkers converge on Jackson</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, snow-choked roads funnel a horde of Stalkers toward Jackson, culminating in a set-piece that sees Tommy square off against a towering Bloater inside the town gates. The showdown—praised by reviewers as a “budget flexer” that “lets mayhem take hold”—cements Tommy (Gabriel Luna) as the settlement’s reluctant protector just as Ellie’s world collapses.</p>

        <h2>Production craft and early verdicts</h2>
        <p>HBO filmed the massacre sequence on a purpose-built lodge set inside Vancouver’s Mammoth Studios, combining 360-degree LED backdrops with practical gore effects. IGN’s review called the episode “stunningly shot,” noting that snow-slick mountain vistas and snarling Clickers “rise from the white in incredible detail.” Polygon praised the writers for giving Abby a larger moral footprint, arguing the tweak “intensifies viewer perception of her as a tragic threat rather than just a vengeful figure.”</p>

        <h2>Commercial impact</h2>
        <p>The creative gamble appears to be paying off commercially. Analytics firm Samba TV reported that season 2 is currently the most-watched streaming title in the United States, topping its weekly Top 10 in the run-up to Episode 3.</p>

        <h2>What it means for the road ahead</h2>
        <p>With Joel gone, the drama pivots to Ellie’s pursuit of Abby and her crew, while Jackson reels from twin traumas: a decapitated leadership core and the first mass infected breach in two winters. HBO has shortened the season to seven episodes, and next week’s chapter—also titled “Through the Valley” on early schedules—will chart the immediate fallout as Ellie, Dina and Jesse ride out in search of answers.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “Violence is an expression of love in this world, and its ripple effects are what interest us.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>For Mazin and co-creator Neil Druckmann, the challenge now is sustaining tension without the franchise’s most recognisable face. If Sunday’s episode is any indication, those ripples have already swelled into a narrative tidal wave—one that shows no sign of receding as the season barrels toward its mid-May finale.</p>
