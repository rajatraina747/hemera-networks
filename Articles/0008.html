        <p>Liverpool clinched a record-equalling 20th English league title—and only their second of the Premier League era—after a dominant 5-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Sunday. Arne Slot’s side overturned an early deficit to secure the crown with four games remaining, matching Manchester United’s all-time haul.</p>

        <h2>Early setback and swift response</h2>
        <p>Tottenham stunned the home crowd when former Red Dominic Solanke nodded in from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. Liverpool’s reply was instantaneous: Luis Díaz levelled after a VAR check, Alexis Mac Allister curled in a 20-yard strike to put the hosts ahead, and Cody Gakpo tapped in a third before halftime.</p>

        <h2>Salah and Udogie complete the rout</h2>
        <p>Mohamed Salah, closing in on a third Golden Boot, rifled in his 28th league goal just after the hour mark, before a Destiny Udogie own goal sealed the emphatic victory. Red smoke and renditions of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” reverberated around the stadium as the title was confirmed.</p>

        <h2>Title celebrations</h2>
        <p>Captain Virgil van Dijk, visibly emotional, lifted a makeshift trophy before the Kop. “This one we could share with the supporters—we truly deserve it,” he said, reflecting on Liverpool’s first title won in front of fans since 2020.</p>

        <h2>Slot praises his squad</h2>
        <p>Manager Arne Slot, appointed just nine months ago, credited his team’s “relentless hunger” for the achievement. “You don’t win a league in April by accident,” he told Sky Sports, leading supporters in the club anthem to cap off a historic night.</p>

        <h2>Statistical milestones</h2>
        <p>The champions racked up 91 goals and conceded only 26 all season, posting a 2.46 points-per-game rate—their best since the Premier League adopted 38 fixtures in 1995. Salah’s 28-goal tally tops the scoring charts, while Liverpool dropped a league-low 13 points.</p>

        <h2>What’s next?</h2>
        <p>With their 20th title secured, Liverpool will parade through the city centre this spring. They also have an FA Cup final to look forward to on 17 May against Crystal Palace, offering a chance at a memorable domestic double to crown Slot’s debut campaign.</p>
