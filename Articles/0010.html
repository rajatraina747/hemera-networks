      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi tore up the IPL record book on Monday night, hammering a 35-ball hundred—101 from 38 deliveries—to propel Rajasthan Royals to an eight-wicket stroll past Gujarat Titans and, in the process, become both the youngest centurion in men’s T20 cricket and the owner of the fastest IPL century by an Indian.</p>

        <p>Sending 11 balls over the rope and crunching seven fours, the left-hander raised three figures with a whipped six off Rashid Khan, drawing a roaring standing ovation from a capacity Jaipur crowd. His ton is the second-quickest in the tournament’s 18-year history, bettered only by Chris Gayle’s 30-ball blitz in 2013, and erases Yusuf Pathan’s longstanding 37-ball Indian mark—“even more special to see it broken in Royals colours,” Pathan posted afterwards.</p>

        <p>Suryavanshi’s fireworks powered a 166-run opening stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal (70 off 40) that mowed down Gujarat’s 209 in just 15.5 overs and snapped Rajasthan’s five-match slide. “It’s my dream to score an IPL hundred,” the teenager told broadcasters. “I just see the ball and play—there’s no fear.”</p>

        <p>Already the youngest player ever auctioned by an IPL franchise at 13, Suryavanshi surged onto the senior stage earlier this month with a first-ball six on debut; Monday’s masterclass arrives barely a year after he played Ranji Trophy cricket at 12 and pummelled a 58-ball ton for India U19. Royals captain Sanju Samson called the innings “the stuff of folklore” and hinted the prodigy could yet drag the 2008 champions into the 2025 playoffs.</p>

        <h2>Key numbers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Youngest men’s T20 centurion</strong> — 14 yrs 32 days</li>
          <li><strong>Fastest IPL century by an Indian</strong> — 35 balls</li>
          <li><strong>Boundaries in the innings</strong> — 11 sixes, 7 fours</li>
          <li><strong>Target chased</strong> — 210 in 15.5 overs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The victory lifts Rajasthan from eighth to sixth and keeps faint post-season hopes alive; for the rest of the league, it issues a stark warning that the Royals’ most dangerous weapon now arrives still clad in school uniform.</p>
