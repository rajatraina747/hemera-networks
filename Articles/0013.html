        <p>U.S. stocks clawed back from steep midday losses on Wednesday, giving the Dow Jones Industrial Average its longest winning streak in almost a year and extending the S&P 500’s rally to seven sessions—an upbeat finale to a historically wild April. The Dow added 0.4 percent (<em>≈+141</em> points), and the S&P 500 eked out +0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent.</p>

        <h2>A month of extremes</h2>
        <p>Even with the late-month rebound, the damage from early-April tariff-driven sell-offs lingered: the Dow finished the month down 3.2 percent, the S&P 500 off 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq clung to a 0.9 percent gain. Wall Street’s whipsaw pattern mirrored a news cycle dominated by the White House’s shifting trade stance, a first-quarter GDP contraction of 0.3 percent, and fresh signs of sticky inflation, all of which fed recession chatter.</p>

        <h2>What powered the seven-day rebound?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Earnings beats from Big Tech</strong> — After-hours pops in Meta (+4 percent) and Microsoft (+7 percent) kept buyers engaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Hints of tariff relief</strong> — President Trump’s partial rollback of impending auto-parts levies eased manufacturing fears.</li>
          <li><strong>Rates repricing</strong> — A five-day slide in the 2-year Treasury yield and a 45 bp drop in the 10-year since mid-April revived hopes for Fed cuts as soon as June.</li>
          <li><strong>Dip-buying after April’s crash</strong> — The S&P 500’s 6 percent plunge in the opening week created “valuation pockets investors could not ignore.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inside Wednesday’s swing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early sell-off</strong> — Stocks opened lower after GDP and deflator data fed “stagflation” fears.</li>
          <li><strong>Final-hour turn</strong> — Program buying linked to month-end rebalancing and options hedging flipped the tape positive in the last 30 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Breadth</strong> — Advancers outnumbered decliners 3-to-2 on the NYSE; eight of 11 S&P sectors ended green, led by Industrials and Energy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The road ahead</h2>
        <p>With April’s volatility fresh in mind, strategists warn the market could struggle to extend the win streak without clearer economic signals. Barclays reckons the S&P 500’s upside is capped at 5 percent unless corporate guidance in May proves “recession-resistant.” Meanwhile, hedging volume has spiked against further tariff shocks as the White House enters its next 100-day stretch.</p>
