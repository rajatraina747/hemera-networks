      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Oscar Piastri delivered a blistering late lap to claim pole position for Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix, leading a McLaren one-two that left title rival Lando Norris just 0.071 seconds adrift and denied Max Verstappen a front-row berth in Barcelona. It is McLaren’s first front-row lock-out at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya since Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard in 1998.</p>

        <p>The Australian’s 1 min 11.204 sec effort came on his final run in a session that swung repeatedly between the two orange cars. Verstappen’s Red Bull will start third, ahead of George Russell’s Mercedes, while Lewis Hamilton put his Ferrari fifth, out-qualifying team-mate Charles Leclerc, who managed only seventh behind rookie Mercedes protégé Kimi Antonelli.</p>

        <h2>Top ten grid</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Oscar Piastri (McLaren)</li>
          <li>Lando Norris (McLaren)</li>
          <li>Max Verstappen (Red Bull)</li>
          <li>George Russell (Mercedes)</li>
          <li>Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari)</li>
          <li>Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes)</li>
          <li>Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)</li>
          <li>Pierre Gasly (Alpine)</li>
          <li>Isack Hadjar (Racing Bulls)</li>
          <li>Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How the session unfolded</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Q1 shock:</strong> Local favourite Carlos Sainz, driving a one-off appearance for Williams, was dumped out in 19th after locking up at Turn 10, prompting groans from the grandstands.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic drama:</strong> Williams’ Alex Albon accused Haas drivers of “dirty, dirty” blocking in Q2 after missing the top-ten shoot-out by 0.12 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Final swing:</strong> Verstappen briefly held provisional pole, but a cooling track and fresh soft tyres allowed both McLarens to find another tenth, Piastri stringing together purple first and second sectors to snatch P1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What they said</h2>
        <blockquote>“I knew there was a little more in the car, but you still have to hook it up,” Piastri told Formula 1 TV. “The lap felt mega.”</blockquote>
        <p>Norris called the result “bittersweet” but praised the team’s upgrades: “We’re in a great place for tomorrow.” Verstappen admitted McLaren had the edge on corner exit: “We just lacked traction off the slow turns.”</p>

        <h2>Strategic picture</h2>
        <p>Warm, blustery conditions pushed track temperatures past 46&nbsp;°C in qualifying; Pirelli expects a two-stop race with soft–medium–medium or soft–hard–hard permutations. McLaren, owning both grid slots on the racing line, aim to control tyre wear at a circuit where the long Turn 3 is notorious for punishing the left-front. Red Bull’s higher straight-line speed could become decisive if Verstappen clears one McLaren at the launch.</p>

        <p>Sunday’s forecast calls for identical heat but a 20&nbsp;percent chance of late-race showers—an added variable that may yet disturb McLaren’s best shot at a first victory of 2025. For now, Piastri heads the grid and the championship by three points; the battle resumes when the lights go out at 15:00 local time.</p>
