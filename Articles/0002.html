      <div class="article-body">
        <p>President Donald Trump on Saturday questioned whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin “actually wants to stop this war,” hours after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican and attending the funeral of Pope Francis.</p>

        <p>Speaking to reporters and in a series of posts on his Truth Social account during the overnight flight back to Washington, Trump denounced Russia’s latest missile strikes on Kyiv as “senseless attacks on civilians” and warned that the United States might have to impose “much tougher, secondary sanctions” if the Kremlin continues its assault. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote, adding that Moscow’s behaviour “makes you wonder if he’s playing for time.”</p>

        <h2>Fifteen minutes in St Peter’s Basilica</h2>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Trump and Zelensky spoke privately for roughly 15 minutes inside St Peter’s Basilica, just before the funeral Mass for the late pontiff. White House officials described the exchange as “very productive,” their first face-to-face conversation since a fractious Oval Office meeting in February.</p>
        <p>According to a Ukrainian read-out, Zelensky pressed Trump to maintain military aid and “keep maximum pressure” on Russia, while Trump reiterated his belief that he could broker a cease-fire “within weeks” if Moscow shows good faith. Vatican officials, keen to revive Pope Francis’s long-standing offer to mediate, quietly facilitated the meeting.</p>

        <h2>A harder public line</h2>
        <p>Trump’s sceptical tone marked a sharp pivot from remarks he made just 24 hours earlier, when he told reporters in Rome that a deal with Putin was “very close.” Back in Washington, senior aides suggested that images of scorched apartment blocks in Kyiv—beamed to Air Force One as it taxied for take-off—convinced the president that Moscow might be stalling.</p>
        <p>The comments also outpaced Russia’s messaging. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about Trump’s latest warning, declined to respond directly but said Moscow remained “open to constructive proposals” and that channels with Washington “remain active.”</p>

        <h2>Funeral diplomacy</h2>
        <p>Saturday’s funeral drew more than 120 heads of state or government. In a break with Vatican custom, both Trump and Zelensky were seated in the front row, separated only by protocol advisers—a placement that underscored global attention on the grinding, three-year-old war in Ukraine. Their brief walk down the central aisle attracted sustained applause from mourners.</p>

        <h2>What comes next</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sanctions clock</strong> — Trump told reporters he would give Putin “a matter of weeks, not months” to halt strikes on Ukrainian cities before moving on a new sanctions package that could target Russian banks’ access to SWIFT and energy payments in yuan.</li>
          <li><strong>Envoy shuttle</strong> — Real-estate executive Steve Witkoff, Trump’s unofficial intermediary, is expected in Moscow on Monday for follow-up talks after delivering what the Kremlin called “clarifying questions” from Washington.</li>
          <li><strong>Cease-fire outline</strong> — A draft U.S. proposal seen by European diplomats would freeze forces along current front lines and deploy an OSCE-led monitoring mission, with talks on Crimea postponed to a later stage. Kyiv has not endorsed the plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reaction in Kyiv and Europe</h2>
        <p>Zelensky’s office said the Ukrainian leader “welcomes President Trump’s increased realism,” but insisted any deal must guarantee “full territorial integrity.” European Council President Charles Michel urged Washington to keep allies “closely in the loop,” while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned that sanctions relief “cannot precede verified Russian withdrawal.”</p>

        <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
        <p>Trump is betting that personal diplomacy and economic leverage can end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II. Yet Saturday’s remarks underscore the central dilemma of his peace bid: convincing sceptics in Kyiv and Brussels that Putin is negotiating in earnest—while proving to domestic critics that he is willing to walk away if Moscow drags its feet.</p>
        <p>Whether new sanctions materialise, or the Kremlin blinks first, the coming weeks will test Trump’s self-proclaimed deal-making prowess—and determine if Saturday’s sober tone marks a turning point or just another twist in an already convoluted quest for peace.</p>
